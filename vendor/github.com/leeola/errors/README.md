# errors (unstable & incomplete)

errors is a simple package meant to implement basic error wrapping and summarizing
in Go. It is a convenience library.

Currently this is incomplete and **not intended for use yet**.

# Why did you publish it so early?

Because it's experimental and Go packaging requires a host. I could have used a
private repo somewhere, sure, but why?
